## 5.3 - Tooter

The functionality and appearance of this little blog post machine wasn't the actual focus for this project, because we used Test Driven Development to build it. We got a lot of experience writing tests first and then building code, though very simple, to make those tests pass. One of the most challenging projects during my time at The Iron Yard.
